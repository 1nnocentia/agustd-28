[00:00.500]
[00:16.448] As we grow older, getting to know the world
[00:20.421] And yet, knowing the world felt more like a weakness
[00:24.346] Gazing at a night view so different from this dark room, I murmured the words
[00:32.503] I guess he's getting older and I don't remember
[00:36.644] What were the things I wished for? I'm scared now, where did the fragments of my dreams go?
[00:48.635] Though I’m breathing, it feels like my heart has broken down
[00:53.480] Yeah, to talk about now, finding it hard to hold onto your dream, that’s becoming an adult
[01:04.044]
[01:04.650] I thought I'd change when I turned twenty, I thought I'd change when I graduated
[01:12.078] Shit, like that, that, when I become thirty, so what's changed about me?
[01:20.224]
[01:20.225] Sometimes, tears suddenly pour down with no reason
[01:23.472] The life I wished for, the life I wanted, a so-so life
[01:26.036] Whatever it is, it doesn't matter anymore
[01:26.450]
[01:26.479] For just one day, without any concerns, for just one day, without any worries, to live, to live, to live
[01:34.479] I guess he's getting older and I don't remember
[01:40.635] What were the things I wished for? I'm scared now, where did the fragments of my dreams go?
[01:51.796] Though I’m breathing, it feels like my heart has broken down
[01:57.315] Yeah, to talk about now, finding it hard to hold onto your dream, that’s becoming an adult
